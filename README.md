# Hello-World

The very first line of code used as an example in most programming languages

My names are Adesola Emmanuel Gbenga and i come from Nigeria, i am a student of Data Science in university of West England,Bristol. the most challenging aspect of my life presently is having to study or learn the Python language, though the Language seem fairly easy to learn it is just challenging for me because i have no prior knowledge in programming. This is my first Git Hub repository as well and i am hoping to have fun along the line.
